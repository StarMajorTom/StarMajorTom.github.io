                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p><strong>IN THE BEGINNING</strong> the Primordials constructed the world of Valen by manipulating the Sound of Creation into a new song.  At the close of the sixth verse we crescendoed into the finale; the creation of the race of men. We knew mankind would need guidance to fulfill their destiny so we commanded our children to be that guidance.</p>
                    
                    <p>Mankind prospered greatly through the next several millennia even causing us surprise and joy as some of them evolved into different races thanks to our children. Yet change is inherently unpredictable and so we watched our daughter, Tiamat, lead her followers and like-minded siblings into a war against her perceived weaker siblings and their followers.</p>
                    
                    <p>Those who followed Tiamat were: Lolth, Maglubiyet, Gruumsh, Asmodeus, Yeenoghu, Set, Demogorgon, and Bhaal.<br>Those who opposed Tiamat were: Bahamut, Pelor, Moradin, Corellon, Mystra, Helm, Selune, and Thor.</p>
                    
                    <p>Still others with no allegiance remained neutral or joined sides based on their own desires.</p>
                    
                    <p>Tiamatâ€™s Great War led to uncountable loses of both mortals and gods. It was decided if our experiment was to continue we had no choice but to intervene before the loses were too great. So we did.</p>
                    
                    <p>We buried Tiamat in a tomb of crystal, stone, and magma deep in the core of Valen. With Tiamat handled the rest of her siblings quickly fell in line. We then lifted our command for our children to guide mankind and sealed them behind a gate. They were to no longer interfere in the affairs of mortals unless first asked lest they suffer a fate worse than their sister Tiamat.</p>

                    <p><strong>We hoped</strong> the removal of our daughter and the establisment of the Pactum Divinus would restore our creation but it was not to be.</p>
                    
                    <p>Many of the mortal races soon wished to establish dominion over their plane yet all but one failed. In the end it was the race known as the Drow, through the use of the dark magicks of their progenator Lolth, who united the plane under their rule.</p>
                    
                    <p>Enormous cosmopolitan cities floated throughout the skies of Valen while engineers funneled endless cohorts of slaves into the bowels of the earth with the hopes of finding powerful and ancient relics left over from the time before the Pactum Divinus.</p>
                    
                    <p>Though it brought great prosperity to the people of the Drovian Empire; to outsiders the Pax Dryadalis was seen as cruel and barbarous. Once again we watched as Valen decended into war  as armies made up of men, elves, and dwarves fought against the near limitless Drow.  The war was long and the rebels were hopelessly outmatched by their captors in every regard.  That is until something we didn't think possible happened.</p>
                    
                    <p>The dwarves, working in secret below the great mountains had perfected mechanical life. These 'Warforged', as they called them, were an immovable force. Though Drow weaponry could take them down it was never easy and so, thanks to the youngest race, the oldest empire was toppled.</p>
